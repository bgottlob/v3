Enums, short for enumerations, empower you to limit the possible values of data. They are a type that limits each possible value. The possible values of an `enum` are called variants. Enums also work seamlessly with `match` and other control flow operators to help you express intent in your Rust programs.

You may have heard of them in other languages as well. In Rust, `enums` are most similar to algebraic data types.
